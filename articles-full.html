      <h3 id="as-a-man-thinks">As a Man Thinks in His Heart</h3>

      <p>
        Proverbs 23:7 says, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It is what a man thinks and believes in his heart about himself that creates
        the boundaries of his life. A man can only go as far as he believes. If he
        thinks he can go far, then he can. If he thinks he cannot, then he won’t.
        The enemy’s top strategy is to control what we think and believe about
        ourselves. In this way, he controls destiny and keeps people enslaved to
        unbelief and small thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The enemy will keep us distracted by the cares of this life and its
        challenges. He will use trials to get you to believe that you’re not called,
        able, or qualified. He will make you think there are too many hindrances,
        barriers, and too many reasons you cannot reach your dreams. We cannot allow
        our trials to diminish our identity in Christ and our potential for greater
        influence!
      </p>

      <p>
        What you think is what matters! Don’t allow the negative voices of this world
        to dominate your thinking! Rise up into your new identity in Christ and
        declare what God says about you! You will have more joy and you’ll be more
        fun to be around!
      </p>

      <h3 id="cornstalk-faith">Cornstalk Faith</h3>

      <p>
        Are you complaining your way through all the hell you’re going through,
        or are you holding on to unwavering faith that God is bringing you out?
        We live in a fallen world where a fallen archangel comes to kill, steal,
        and destroy. Because of this, we will go through hard times. The question is,
        how will you go through it?
      </p>

      <p>
        Will you respond in a way that God can deliver you, or in a way that stops
        His power in your life?
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Old Testament, we have the story of Jonah who went through his own
        personal hell when he was swallowed by a whale. This is a real “whale of a
        circumstance” and deliverance looks impossible. This would take the starch
        out of today’s strongest person.
      </p>

      <p>
        But not Jonah! You can hear Jonah’s faith in his words. In Jonah chapter 2,
        verse 2 Jonah has utter confidence that God has heard his prayer. In verse 4
        he says, “I will look again toward Thy holy temple,” which means he had
        absolute faith he was coming out! He makes bold confessions of faith from
        inside the whale!
      </p>

      <p>
        I heard someone say one time that real faith in God will swing out over hell
        on a cornstalk and spit in the devil’s eye! That’s the kind of faith that
        KNOWS God is on your side! You know the rest of Jonah’s story. God spoke to
        the whale and Jonah came out of that whale of a circumstance... just like he
        said he would! What are you saying about your circumstance?
      </p>

      <p>
        Why not have some cornstalk faith? Go ahead and rear back, spit in the devil’s
        eye and tell your circumstance and tell the devil, “I’m coming out of here”!
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 id="future-to-chance">Don’t Leave Your Future to Chance</h3>

      <p>
        Did you know God has a great future for you? It’s a really good future. It’s
        not just a drab existence where you have no purpose and no drive. It’s a
        divine plan powered by vision, faith, and God Almighty! It’s a fulfilling,
        rewarding purpose that will give you more joy and satisfaction than you can
        imagine!
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you know what it is? If you don’t know what it is, will you continue on
        the same road you are on thinking that if God is in it, it will happen? That
        is not how it works. Many people are leaving their futures to chance, unaware
        that they hold the reins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don’t leave your future to chance! Your future is too important to leave it
        to chance. Don’t leave your future in the hands of a “whatever will be will
        be” attitude. This is a lost and mindless mentality where all people get done
        is treading water. Someone said, “To get anywhere you must launch out for
        somewhere or you will get nowhere!”
      </p>

      <p>
        How many of God’s people have no plan for their future and no plan to
        implement it? How many of God’s people have no idea of what God has planned
        for their life and their future? They have let the world, life, struggles,
        and sometimes the enemy take charge of their future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are the ones who have to take charge of our future. God has given us His
        Word, the tools, and all we need to accomplish the unimaginable. We not only
        have to take the wheel — we must take charge of the ignition and step on the
        gas pedal!
      </p>

      <p>
        People need to start praying that God will show them His plan for their life
        because His plan is already blessed! Start confessing, “God is leading me
        into His perfect plan for my life!”
