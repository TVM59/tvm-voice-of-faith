  <h3>As a Man Thinks in His Heart</h3>

  <p>
    Proverbs 23:7 says, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is what a man thinks and believes in his heart about himself that creates
    the boundaries of his life. A man can only go as far as he believes. If he
    thinks he can go far, then he can. If he thinks he cannot, then he won’t.
    The enemy’s top strategy is to control what we think and believe about
    ourselves. In this way, he controls destiny and keeps people enslaved to
    unbelief and small thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The enemy works to keep us distracted by the cares of this life and its
    challenges. He will use trials to convince you that you are not called,
    able, or qualified. He will whisper that there are too many hindrances,
    barriers, and reasons you cannot reach your God-given dreams. We must not
    allow trials to diminish our identity in Christ or our potential for
    greater influence.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you think is what matters. Do not allow the negative voices of this
    world to dominate your thinking. Rise up into your new identity in Christ
    and declare what God says about you. When you do, you will walk in greater
    joy — and you’ll be more enjoyable to be around!
