        As A Man Thinks!
        Proverbs 23:7 says, as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.

It is what a man thinks, and believes in his heart about himself that creates the boundaries of his life. Man can only go as far as he believes. If he thinks he can go far, then he can. If he thinks he cannot, then he wont. So, the enemies top strategy for us all is to control what we think and believe about ourselves. In this way he controls our destiny and keeps us enslaved to the chains of unbelief and small thinking.



The enemy will keep us distracted by the cares of this life and its challenges. The enemy will use trials to get you to believe that you’re not called, able or qualified. He will make you think there are too many hindrances, barriers and too many reasons you cannot reach your dreams. We cannot allow our trials to diminish our identity in Christ and our potential for greater influence!



What you think is what matters! Don't allow the negative voices of this world to dominate your thinking! Rise up into your new identity in Christ and declare what God says about you! You will have more joy and you'll be more fun to be around!
