      <p>
        This section is dedicated to written teachings that help strengthen faith,
        clarify Scripture, and encourage believers in their walk with the Lord.

  <h3>As a Man Thinks in His Heart</h3>

  <p>
    Proverbs 23:7 says, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is what a man thinks and believes in his heart about himself that creates
    the boundaries of his life. A man can only go as far as he believes. If he
    thinks he can go far, then he can. If he thinks he cannot, then he won’t.
    The enemy’s top strategy is to control what we think and believe about
    ourselves. In this way, he controls destiny and keeps people enslaved to
    unbelief and small thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The enemy works to keep us distracted by the cares of this life and its
    challenges. He will use trials to convince you that you are not called,
    able, or qualified. He will whisper that there are too many hindrances,
    barriers, and reasons you cannot reach your God-given dreams. We must not
    allow trials to diminish our identity in Christ or our potential for
    greater influence.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you think is what matters. Do not allow the negative voices of this
    world to dominate your thinking. Rise up into your new identity in Christ
    and declare what God says about you. When you do, you will walk in greater
    joy — and you’ll be more enjoyable to be around!

  <h3>Cornstalk Faith</h3>

  <p>
    Are you complaining your way through all the hell you’re going through,
    or are you holding on to unwavering faith that God is bringing you out?
    We live in a fallen world where a fallen archangel comes to kill, steal,
    and destroy. Because of this, we will go through hard times. The real
    question is not <em>if</em> we will face trials, but <em>how</em> we will
    go through them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will you respond in a way that allows God to deliver you, or in a way
    that stops His power from working in your life?
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Old Testament, we see the story of Jonah, who went through his
    own personal hell when he was swallowed by a whale. We all know how that
    story would have ended if he hadn’t escaped — fish food eventually
    becomes fish poo. This was truly a “whale of a circumstance,” where
    deliverance looked impossible. It would take the starch out of even the
    strongest person today.
  </p>

  <p>
    But not Jonah. You can hear his faith in his words. In Jonah chapter 2,
    verse 2, Jonah expresses absolute confidence that God has heard his
    prayer. In verse 4 he declares, “I will look again toward Thy holy
    temple,” which means he fully believed he was coming out. From inside
    the whale, Jonah made bold confessions of faith.
  </p>

  <p>
    I once heard someone say that real faith will swing out over hell on a
    cornstalk and spit in the devil’s eye. That’s the kind of faith that KNOWS 
    God is on your side! You know the rest of Jonahs story. God spoke to the 
    whale and Jonah came out of that whale of a circumstance... just like 
    he said he would! What are you saying about your circumstance?

    Why not have some cornstalk faith? Go ahead and rare back, spit in 
    the devils eye and tell your circumstance and tell the devil, 
    “I'm coming out of here”!

      </p>

      <div class="card" id="future-to-chance">
  <h3>Don’t Leave Your Future to Chance</h3>

  <p>
    Did you know that God has a great future for you? It is a truly good
    future — not a drab existence with no purpose or drive. God’s plan is
    a divine design powered by vision, faith, and God Almighty Himself.
    It is a fulfilling and rewarding purpose that will bring more joy
    and satisfaction than you can imagine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you know what that plan is? If you don’t, will you continue on the
    same road you’re on, assuming that if God is in it, everything will
    somehow just happen? That’s not how it works. Many people leave their
    futures to chance, unaware that they are the ones holding the reins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don’t leave your future to chance. Your future is far too important
    to trust to a “whatever will be, will be” mentality. That mindset is
    passive and mindless — it leaves people simply treading water.
    Someone once said, “To get anywhere, you must launch out for somewhere,
    or you will get nowhere.”
  </p>

  <p>
    How many of God’s people have no plan for their future and no plan to
    implement it? How many have no idea what God has planned for their life?
    Instead, they allow the world, life’s struggles, and sometimes the enemy
    to take charge of their future.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are the ones who must take responsibility for our future. God has
    already given us His Word, the tools, and everything we need to
    accomplish what once seemed unimaginable. We must not only take the
    wheel — we must take control of the ignition and step on the gas pedal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Begin praying that God will reveal His plan for your life, because His
    plan is already blessed. Start confessing boldly,
    “God is leading me into His perfect plan for my life.”
